# DNPAssignment3
Expansion of DNP assigment 1 and 2, so the Web Service retrieves the data from the database rather than a file.

## Project Summary
A Blazor webisite that acts as a visual persons database that is using a .Net web API which uses SQLite database to get all the data.

## What did I learn?
Mainly Entity Framework Core (EFC). I used it in the web API to store all the data including the login credentials.
